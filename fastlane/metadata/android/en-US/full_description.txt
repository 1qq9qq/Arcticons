A line-based icon pack forked from Frost but rebuild with consistent sizing and adjustments specifically for lines in mind. Arcticons is FOSS and provides mostly icons for open-source apps on F-Droid (but there are many other apps in this pack too). The design is simple and clean with minimal lines that give you a nice see-trough effect.

There are over <b>1800 icons</b> right now!

If you're missing icons, you can submit an icon request or create them yourself! But creating & maintaining this icon pack takes a lot of time, so be patient and consider donating a few bucks if you like the project!
