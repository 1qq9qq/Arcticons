# Building your own Arcticons flavor

Arcticons is currently set up to support more than one color.
You can set it up easily by copying the black or white folder and renaming it to whatever color you like.

From there you can add the new color to the `build gradle` here:

In the `build gradle` you can change, add & delete the different collor options by modifying these lines to your liking:

Make sure to include the suffix in your flavor or else it will override the default Arcticons pack.

If you followed these steps correctly, you've changed the app name and added a build flavor correctly!
