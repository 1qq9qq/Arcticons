Arcticons (Arctic icons) is a line-based icon pack forked from [Frost](https://github.com/dkanada/frost) but rebuild with consistent sizing and adjustments specifically for lines in mind. Arcticons is FOSS and provides mostly icons for open-source apps on F-Droid (but there are many other apps in this pack too). The design is simple and clean with minimal lines that give you a nice see-trough effect

Arcticons includes support for a lot of lauchers like Trebuchet, KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more. The installation depends on your launcher, it's probably somewhere in the settings. **There are over 1500 icons.**

Submitting icon requests helps a lot, but maintaining the project (as you may imagine) takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about adding new icons. Contributions for new icons are always welcome, and no experience with programming is necessary.

## Icon Requests

This app doesn't have an icon request feature, so you'll have to do the following steps.

1. **Install [Turtl](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.xphnx.iconsubmit)** which can extract the icons and class names of your apps.
2. **Grant the storage access permission to Turtl** in your system settings, this will allow it to save the zip file (Only required in Android 6 "Marshmallow" or newer, older versions grant this permission on installation).
3. **Open Turtl** and follow the process to save the new zip file to your phone.
4. **[Make an issue](https://github.com/Donnnno/frost-lines/issues/new)** titled "Icon Request" and attach the zip file.

## Donate

Maintaining this icon-pack costs a lot of time, besides making icons I'm curating every single icon if it has the right sizing and other design rules. So if you like the icons and want to support the development consider supporting :)

## Contributing

Making icons is fun and **you don't even have to know how to code**. Just install a vector graphic program like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/).
